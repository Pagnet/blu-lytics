# Reporting security issues

The Blu projects and their implementations are still under heavy development, which implies that they could contain security flaws and bugs.

We take security issues very seriously, especially in our context of developing secure messaging tools.

Whether you are a security expert or not, if you detect a vulnerability in our code. Please bring it to our attention right away!

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please **DO NOT** file a public issue; instead, send us your report privately to seguranca@useblu.com.br.

If the issue is a weakness that cannot be immediately exploited or something that hasn't been released yet, feel free to publicly talk about it, if possible, in a GitHub issue.
